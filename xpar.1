.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B xpar
command
is the command-line interface to an error/erasure code system which
fortifies data and corrects errors in the data or reconstructs missing
shards.
.PP
.B xpar
in joint encoding mode (
.B \-Je
) generates a slightly inflated (by about 12%) parity-guarded
file from a given data file with the extension
.I .xpar
. Such a file can be recovered as long as no more than about 6.2% of the
data is corrupted. xpar internally uses a (255,223)-RS code over an 8-bit
Galois field. At most two filenames intertwined with flags are expected
as arguments.
.B xpar
will by default not overwrite existing files. If this behaviour is intended,
use the
.B \-f
option.
If no file names are specified,
.B xpar
will process data from the standard input and write it to the standard output,
refusing to output binary data to a terminal. If two files are specified,
the first one is used in place of standard input, and the second one is used
in place of standard output. If the -c flag is present,
.B xpar
will read from the specified file and output data to standard output instead.
Otherwise, if decoding, 
.B xpar
will try to guess the decompressed filename by removing the
.I .xpar
extension. If not present, an error will be reported. If encoding
the output filename will be generated by appending the
.I .xpar
extension to the input filename.
.PP
In joint mode, the flag
.B \-i/\-\-interlacing
can be used to specify the interlacing factor. This does not affect the
nominal error correction capability (in the sense of a noisy memory-less
channel model), but can be used to increase the robustness against burst
errors. The default interlacing factor is 1 and the maximum correctible burst
error length is 16 (as given by the Singleton bound). The interlacing factor
of 2 transposes 65025-byte blocks of data and hence can correct burst errors
of length 4080. The interlacing factor of 3 transposes approx. 16MB blocks of
data and can correct burst errors of length approx. 1MB. In theory, with the
interlacing factor of one, up to 32 burst errors could be corrected - this
problem is however NP-hard and reduces to polynomial reconstruction (the basis
of e.g. Shamir's secret sharing scheme). As an added benefit, higher
interlacing factors tend to result in faster processing (up to 50%) as the
workload is more parallelisable.
.PP
.B xpar
in sharded encoding mode (
.B \-We
or
.B \-Le
or
.B \-Ce
) generates a set of parity-guarded files from a given data file. The amount
of files generated is given by the sum of the mandatory parameters
.B \--dshards
and
.B \--pshards
- which specify the number of data and parity shards, respectively. The data
shards contain the file contents verbatim (
.B xpar\ 
uses a systematic code). The data is reconstructible as long as there are more
than
.B \--dshards
shards available.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-W --van-sharded
Enable sharded processing mode using Vandermonde matrices in O(n^3) via the
Berlekamp-Welch algorithm. Slowest sharded mode, parallelisable.
.B \-L --fft-sharded
Enable sharded processing mode using FFT in O(n log n) via the Leopard
algorithm. Fastest sharded mode.
.B \-C --cauchy-sharded
Enable sharded processing mode using Cauchy matrices in O(n^2). Medium-speed.
Likely faster than the FFT for small files.
.TP
.B \-J --joint
Enable joint processing mode.
.TP
.B \-e --encode
Enable encoding mode.
.TP
.B \-d --decode
Enable decoding mode.
.TP
.B \-h --help
Print a help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-f --force
Force operation. Ignore errors and try to recover from them, if possible.
Overwrite existing files.
.TP
.B \-v --verbose
Be verbose. Print additional information.
.TP
.B \-q --quiet
Be quiet. Suppress most output, except fatal errors.
.TP
.B \-V --version
Print version information of the package and exit.
.TP
.B \-c --stdout
Write resultant data to standard output. Joint mode only.
.TP
.B \-i --interlacing
Specify the interlacing factor. Joint mode only.
.TP
.B \--no-mmap
Disable memory mapping. Generally results in worse performance, as the
fallback method is to read the file in chunks using the standard I/O library.
.TP
.B \-j --jobs
Specify the amount of CPU cores to use. Not setting this value or setting it
to zero will result in the program automatically deciding the amount of cores
to use. Setting it to one will disable parallel processing.
.TP
.B \--out-prefix
Specify the prefix for the output files (shards). Sharded mode only.
.TP
.B \--dshards
Specify the number of data shards. Sharded mode only. Mandatory.
.TP
.B \--pshards
Specify the number of parity shards. Sharded mode only. Mandatory.
