This file contains release notes for major and minor releases of xpar.
For a complete list of source-level changes, consult the ChangeLog file.

===============================================================================
v0.7 (19-09-2025)
- Rename the sharded mode to Vandermonde-sharded mode (-S => -W).
- Update building instructions for specific architecture and operating system
  combinations.
- Include benchmarks in the repository.
- Introduce minimum shard size.
- Improve stability without --no-mmap.
- Add FFT-based Reed-Solomon encoders and decoders that operate in
  linearithmic time (@catid).
- Fix a memory leak in gf256mat_inv used by the Vandermonde-sharded mode.
- Update and reflow the man-page.

===============================================================================
v0.6 (10-09-2025)

===============================================================================
v0.5 (17-10-2024)
- OpenMP support for sharded mode (which unfortunately seems bottlenecked by
  I/O). 
- Switch to yarg for command-line parsing, remove dependency on Rich Felker's
  `getopt_long`.
- Hopefully the last v0.x release. Hopefully, it will receive some feedback
  which will help to introduce future improvements and release v1.0. The file
  format will not change from now on, unless there is a bug or another major
  misfeature that needs to be fixed.

===============================================================================
v0.4 (16-10-2024)
- x86_64 static Linux binaries are no longer provided.
- OpenMP support has been added to improve encoding and decoding performance
  in joint mode with high interlacing factors on multi-core machines.
- 3-way saturating CRC32C implementation has been added to improve performance
  on x86_64 machines that support SSE4.2.
- Slightly improve the performance of the sharded mode.
- Fix undefined behaviour in sharded mode regarding int shifts.

===============================================================================
v0.3 (16-10-2024)
- Improve joint encoding performance on x86_64 machines.
- Support aarch64 Linux.
- Improve cross-platform compatibility of the sharded mode.

===============================================================================
v0.2 (15-10-2024)
- Provides a manual page for the xpar command.
- Provides platform-specific code for aarch64, which can be enabled via
  the --enable-aarch64 configure option.

===============================================================================
v0.1 (14-10-2024)
- Initial release.
- Supports joint mode and sharded mode for error and erasure correction.
- Provides platform-specific code for x86_64, which can be enabled via
  the --enable-x86_64 configure option.
- Tested on x86_64 Linux (Ubuntu), x86_64 and aarch64 MacOS and x86_64 and
  i686 Windows.
