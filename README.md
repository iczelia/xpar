xpar in joint mode generates a slightly inflated (by about 12%) parity-guarded
file from a given data file. Such a file can be recovered as long as no more
than about 6.2% of the data is corrupted. xpar internally uses a (255,223)-RS
code over an 8-bit Galois field.

## Building

```
# If using a git clone (not needed for source packages), first...
$ ./bootstrap

# All...
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

## Usage

Consult the man page.

## Disclaimer

The file format will change until the stable version v1.0 is reached.
Do not use xpar for critical data, do not expect backwards or forwards
compatibility until then.

# Development 

A rough outline of some development-related topics below.

## Repository management

As it stands:
- `contrib/` - holds scripts and other non-source files that are not present
  in the distribution tarball and not supported.
- `NEWS` - will contain the release notes for each release and needs to be
  modified before each release.
- `ChangeLog` - generated via `make update-ChangeLog`; intended to be
  re-generated before each release.

Code style:
- Two space indent, brace on the same line, middle pointers - `char * p;`.
